# Meet Plugin for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Individuals

## Overview

Millions of individuals with disabilities face significant barriers to communication, especially during online meetings. The Meet Plugin for Deaf and Hard of Hearing aims to address these challenges by providing a solution that integrates real-time sign language interpretation into virtual meeting platforms, promoting inclusivity and engagement for all participants.

### Problem Statement

Despite advancements in accessibility technology, many online meeting platforms lack robust support for individuals with disabilities, particularly those who rely on sign language. Current platforms offer limited accessibility features, such as closed captioning or screen reader support, but fall short of offering real-time sign language integration, further perpetuating exclusion and marginalization.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Sign Language Interpretation**: Seamlessly integrates sign language interpreters or AI-driven sign language translation into online meetings, allowing participants who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow discussions in real time.
- **Enhanced Accessibility Options**: In addition to sign language support, the plugin offers closed captioning and screen reader compatibility, ensuring a multi-modal approach to accessibility.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, the plugin allows users to easily toggle between accessibility features without disrupting the flow of the meeting.
- **Platform Compatibility**: The plugin is compatible with popular online meeting platforms like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet, making it a flexible solution for various virtual environments.

### Challenges Addressed
1. **Limited Sign Language Integration**: Many platforms lack built-in support for sign language interpretation, making it difficult for deaf or hard-of-hearing participants to engage fully. This plugin ensures real-time integration, breaking down those barriers.
2. **Communication Barriers**: Without real-time interpretation, individuals with disabilities often miss out on crucial parts of discussions. The plugin bridges that gap by offering a smooth, real-time experience.
3. **Inadequate Accessibility Features**: Current online platforms may provide closed captioning or screen reader support, but often neglect sign language interpretation. This plugin prioritizes sign language as a core accessibility feature, alongside other options.
